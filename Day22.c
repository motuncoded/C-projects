/*
Write a C program that takes a string as input from the user 
and checks if the string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that remains the same when its characters are reversed. If the string is a palindrome, the program should print "The string is a palindrome." 
Otherwise, it should print "The string is not a palindrome."*/
