/*
In C, a preprocessor is a program that processes the 
source code before it is compiled. 
The preprocessor reads the source code, 
performs certain operations on it, 
and then passes the modified code to the compiler.
examples of preprocessor
#include, #define, #undef, #ifdef, #ifnded etc
*/

/*
for example if we use #include <stdio.h>, we will  be able to use the printf() and scanf()

Create a program to find the square root
of a number using the sqrt() function and
macro together.

 Include the math.h header file.
 Define a macro function squareRoot(n).
 Inside the main function, use the 
  squareRoot() macro to compute the 
  square root
